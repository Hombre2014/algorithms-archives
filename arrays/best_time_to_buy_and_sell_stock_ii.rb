# Approach 2: Peak Valley Approach
#

# Algorithm:
#
# Say the given array is: [7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4].

# If we analyze the graph, we notice that the points of interest are the consecutive
# valleys and peaks. Mathematically speaking:
# Total Profit = âˆ‘(height(peak_i) - height(valley_i)).
# The key point is we need to consider every peak immediately following a valley
# to maximize the profit. In case we skip one of the peaks (trying to obtain more
# profit), we will end up losing the profit over one of the transactions leading
# to an overall lesser profit.
#
# For example, in the above case, if we skip peak_i and valley_j trying to obtain
# more profit by considering points with more difference in heights, the net profit
# obtained will always be lesser than the one obtained by including them, since C
# will always be lesser than A+B.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n)
# Space complexity: O(1)

    valley = prices[i]

    i += 1 while i < prices.length - 1 && prices[i] <= prices[i + 1]

    peak = prices[i]

    maxprofit += peak - valley

# Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e.,
# max profit = 0.

#
# Approach 3: Simple One Pass
#

# Algorithm:
#
# This solution follows the logic used in Approach 2 itself,
# but with only a slight variation. In this case, instead of looking
# for every peak following a valley, we can simply go on crawling
# over the slope and keep on adding the profit obtained from every
# consecutive transaction. In the end,we will be using the peaks
# and valleys effectively, but we need not track the costs
# corresponding to the peaks and valleys along with the maximum
# profit, but we can directly keep on adding the difference between
# the consecutive numbers of the array if the second number is larger
# than the first one, and at the total sum we obtain will be the
# maximum profit. This approach will simplify the solution. This
# can be made clearer by taking this example:
# [1, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 6, 7]
