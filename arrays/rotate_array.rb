# Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps,

# Try to come up as many solutions as you can,
# there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
# Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
#

#
# Approach 1: Brute Force
#

# The simplest approach is to rotate all the elements of the
# array in k steps by rotating the elements by 1 unit in each step.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(nÃ—k).
# All the numbers are shifted by one O(n) k times.
# Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
def rotate(nums, k)
  k.times do |_i|

  end

nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
# => [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

nums = [-1, -100, 3, 99]
k = 2
rotate(nums, k)
# => [3,99,-1,-100]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]

#
# Approach 2: Using Extra Array
#

# Algorithm

# We use an extra array in which we place every element of the
# array at its correct position i.e. the number at index i
# in the original array is placed at the index (i + k) length
# of array. Then, we copy the new array to the original one.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n). One pass is used to put the numbers
# in the new array. And another pass to copy the new array
# to the original one.

# Space complexity: O(n). Another array of the same size is used.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.

# Approach 4: Using Reverse
#

# Algorithm
#
# This approach is based on the fact that when we rotate
# the array k times, k%nk elements from the back end of
# the array come to the front and the rest of the elements
# from the front shift backwards.
#
# In this approach, we firstly reverse all the elements
# of the array. Then, reversing the first k elements
# followed by reversing the rest n-k elements gives us
# the required result.
#
# Let n = 7 and k = 3.
#
# Original List                   : 1 2 3 4 5 6 7
# After reversing all numbers     : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
# After reversing first k numbers : 5 6 7 4 3 2 1
# After revering last n-k numbers : 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 --> Result

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n). n elements are reversed a total of three times.
# Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.

def rotate(nums, k)
  mod_k = k % nums.length
  return if k == 0

  # reverse the whole array
  reverse(nums, 0, nums.length - 1)
