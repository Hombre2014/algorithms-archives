# Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps,
# where k is non-negative.

# Follow up:
#
# Try to come up as many solutions as you can,
# there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.
# Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?
#

#
# Approach 1: Brute Force
#

# The simplest approach is to rotate all the elements of the
# array in k steps by rotating the elements by 1 unit in each step.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(nÃ—k).
# All the numbers are shifted by one O(n) k times.
# Space complexity: O(1). No extra space is used.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
def rotate(nums, k)
  k.times do |i|
    previous = nums.last

    nums.count.times do |j|
      nums[j], previous = previous, nums[j]
    end
  end

  print(nums)
end

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
# => [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

nums = [-1,-100,3,99]
k = 2
rotate(nums, k)
# => [3,99,-1,-100]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]


# Approach 2: Using Extra Array

# Algorithm

# We use an extra array in which we place every element of the
# array at its correct position i.e. the number at index i
# in the original array is placed at the index (i + k) length
# of array. Then, we copy the new array to the original one.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n). One pass is used to put the numbers
# in the new array. And another pass to copy the new array
# to the original one.

# Space complexity: O(n). Another array of the same size is used.

# @param {Integer[]} nums
# @param {Integer} k
# @return {Void} Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
def rotate(nums, k)
  k = k % nums.length
  new_array = []
  start = nums.length - k

  for i in (start...nums.length) do
    new_array.push(nums[i])
  end

  for i in (0...start) do
    new_array.push(nums[i])
  end

  new_array.each_with_index do |value, index|
    nums[index] = value
  end
end

nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
k = 3
rotate(nums, k)
# => [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [7,1,2,3,4,5,6]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [6,7,1,2,3,4,5]
# rotate 3 steps to the right: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

nums = [-1,-100,3,99]
k = 2
rotate(nums, k)
# => [3,99,-1,-100]

# Explanation:
# rotate 1 steps to the right: [99,-1,-100,3]
# rotate 2 steps to the right: [3,99,-1,-100]
