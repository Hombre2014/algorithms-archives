# Shortest Word Distance

# Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2,
# return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

# Solution:
# This is a straight-forward coding problem. The distance between any two
# positions `i1` and `i2` in an array is `|i1 - i2|`. To find the shortest
# distance between word1 and word2, we need to traverse the input array and
# find all occurrences i1 and i2 of the two words, and check if |i1 - i2| is
# less than the minimum distance computed so far.

#
# Approach #1 (Brute Force)
#

# Algorithm
#
# A naive solution to this problem is to go through the entire array looking for
# the first word. Every time we find an occurrence of the first word, we search
# the entire array for the closest occurrence of the second word.

# Complexity Analysis

# Time complexity: O(n^2), since for every occurrence of word1,
# we traverse the entire array in search for the closest occurrence of word2.
# Space complexity: O(1), since no additional space is used.

# @param {String[]} words
# @param {String} word1
# @param {String} word2
# @return {Integer}

    words.each_with_index do |_, j|

      diff = (i - j).abs

      min_distance = diff if min_distance > diff

words = %w[practice makes perfect coding makes]
word1 = 'makes'
word2 = 'coding'

#
# Approach #2 (One-pass)
#

# Algorithm
#
# We can greatly improve on the brute-force approach by keeping two indices
# i1 and i2 where we store the most recent locations of word1 and word2.
# Each time we find a new occurrence of one of the words, we do not need to
# search the entire array for the other word, since we already have the index
# of its most recent occurrence.

# Complexity Analysis
#
# Time complexity: O(Nâ‹…M) where N is the number of words in the input list,
# and M is the total length of two input words.
#
# Space complexity: O(1), since no additional space is allocated.
