# Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it
# while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

# Example:

# Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
# Output: [1,3,12,0,0]


# Note:

# You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
# Minimize the total number of operations.


# In-place means we should not be allocating any space for extra array.
# But we are allowed to modify the existing array. However, as a first step,
# try coming up with a solution that makes use of additional space.
# For this problem as well, first apply the idea discussed using an additional
# array and the in-place solution will pop up eventually.

# A two-pointer approach could be helpful here. The idea would be to have
# one pointer for iterating the array and another pointer that just
# works on the non-zero elements of the array.

# Approach #1 (Space Sub-Optimal)

# 1. Count the zeroes
# 2. Make all the non-zero elements retain their original order
# 3. Move all zeroes to the end
# 4. Combine the result

# Complexity Analysis

# Space Complexity: O(n).
# Since we are creating the "new" array to store results.

# Time Complexity: O(n).
# However, the total number of operations are sub-optimal.
# We can achieve the same result in less number of operations.

# If asked in an interview, the below solution would be a good start.
# You can explain the interviewer (not code) the above and build
# your base for the next Optimal Solution.

def move_zeroes(nums)
  count = nums.select { |i| i.zero? }.count

  new = []
  nums.each do |value|
    if value != 0
      new.push(value)
    end
  end

  count.times { new.push(0) }

  nums.each_with_index do |value, index|
    nums[index] = new[index]
  end

  nums
end

move_zeroes([0,1,0,3,12])
# => [1,3,12,0,0]

# Approach #2 (Space Optimal, Operation Sub-Optimal)

# This approach works the same way as above, i.e., first fulfills
# one requirement and then another. The catch? It does it in a clever way.
# The above problem can also be stated in alternate way, "Bring all the non
# 0 elements to the front of array keeping their relative order same".

# This is a 2 pointer approach. The fast pointer which is denoted by
# variable "cur" does the job of processing new elements. If the newly
# found element is not a 0, we record it just after the last found non-0
# element. The position of last found non-0 element is denoted by the slow
# pointer "last_non_zero_found_at" variable. As we keep finding new non-0 elements,
# we just overwrite them at the "last_non_zero_found_at + 1" 'th index. This
# overwrite will not result in any loss of data because we already processed
# what was there(if it were non-0,it already is now written at
# it's corresponding index, or if it were 0 it will be handled later in time).

# After the "cur" index reaches the end of array, we now know that all
# the non-0 elements have been moved to beginning of array in their original
# order. Now comes the time to fulfil other requirement, "Move all 0's to the
# end". We now simply need to fill all the indexes after the
# "last_non_zero_found_at" index with 0.

def move_zeroes(nums)
# TBD
end

move_zeroes([0,1,0,3,12])
# => [1,3,12,0,0]


# Approach #3 (Optimal)

# The total number of operations of the previous approach is sub-optimal. For example, the array which has all (except last) leading zeroes: [0, 0, 0, ..., 0, 1].How many write operations to the array? For the previous approach, it writes 0's n-1nâˆ’1 times, which is not necessary. We could have instead written just once. How? ..... By only fixing the non-0 element,i.e., 1.
# The optimal approach is again a subtle extension of above solution. A simple realization is if the current element is non-0, its' correct position can at best be it's current position or a position earlier. If it's the latter one, the current position will be eventually occupied by a non-0 ,or a 0, which lies at a index greater than 'cur' index. We fill the current position by 0 right away,so that unlike the previous solution, we don't need to come back here in next iteration.
# In other words, the code will maintain the following invariant:
# All elements before the slow pointer (lastNonZeroFoundAt) are non-zeroes.
# All elements between the current and slow pointer are zeroes.
# Therefore, when we encounter a non-zero element, we need to swap elements pointed by current and slow pointer, then advance both pointers. If it's zero element, we just advance current pointer.
# With this invariant in-place, it's easy to see that the algorithm will work.

# Space Complexity: O(1). Only constant space is used.

# Time Complexity: O(n).
# However, the total number of operations are optimal.
# The total operations (array writes) that code does is
# Number of non-0 elements.This gives us a much better best-case
# (when most of the elements are 0) complexity than last solution.
# However, the worst-case (when all elements are non-0) complexity
# for both the algorithms is same.

def move_zeroes(nums)
# TBD
