# Algorithms

## In-place Algorithm

An in-place algorithm is an algorithm which transforms input using no auxiliary data structure. However, a small amount of extra storage space is allowed for auxiliary variables. The input is usually overwritten by the output as the algorithm executes. In-place algorithm updates input sequence only through replacement or swapping of elements. An algorithm which is not in-place is sometimes called not-in-place or out-of-place.

## Searching

### Linear Search

Linear search is the simplest algorithm used to search sequentially in a collection. It traverses the given collection linearly and compare each element with value being searched until value is found and or we hit the end of collection.

Only thing required is a logic to traverse given collection linearly. Some data structures like array, linked list, queue, stack, etc are sequential in the way they arrange data within themselves. Traversing such data structures linearly is natural and easy. For example, an array can be traversed linearly from either left-to-right or right-to-left, the sequence is deterministic and very intuitive. But if collection is a Binary tree, we can traverse the nodes sequentially in multiple ways, in-order, pre-order, post-order, level-order, reverse-level-order, etc.

In this section, I'm reviewing different collection where we apply linear search algorithms.
