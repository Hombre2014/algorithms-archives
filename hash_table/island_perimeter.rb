# You are given row x col grid representing a map where grid[i][j] = 1 represents land and grid[i][j] = 0 represents water.
#
# Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically (not diagonally). The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there is exactly one island (i.e., one or more connected land cells).
#
# The island doesn't have "lakes", meaning the water inside isn't connected to the water around the island. One cell is a square with side length 1. The grid is rectangular, width and height don't exceed 100. Determine the perimeter of the island.
#
# Example 1:
# Input: grid = [[0,1,0,0],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,0],[1,1,0,0]]
# Output: 16
# Explanation: The perimeter is the 16 yellow stripes in the image above.
#
# Example 2:
#
# Input: grid = [[1]]
# Output: 4
#
# Example 3:
#
# Input: grid = [[1,0]]
# Output: 4

# Complexity Analysis
#
# Time complexity: O(mn) where mm is the number of rows of the grid and nn is
# the number of columns of the grid. Since two for loops go through all the cells
# on the grid, for a two-dimensional grid of size nmÃ—n, the algorithm would have
# to check mnmn cells.
#
# Space complexity: O(1). Only the result variable is updated and there is no
# other space requirement.
